# Hows The Weather: A Weather Dashboard  ![License](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=License&message=MIT&color=blueviolet&style=plastic)

This project is a weather dashboard that runs in a web browser that retrieves data from the third party API: Open Weather. Accessing the functionality of the API is done by making requests with specific parameters using a URL and API Key and storing searches within the `localStorage`.

## **Summary**

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. How's The Weather is a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It features a search bar, locally saved searches, today's weather stats, and a 5 day weather forecast using a weather API.

### User Story

``` html
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

### How it Should Work

``` html
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN you search for a city
THEN you am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN you view current weather conditions for that city
THEN you am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN you view the UV index
THEN you am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN you view future weather conditions for that city
THEN you am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN you click on a city in the search history
THEN you am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
